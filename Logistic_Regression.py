n Python we have modules that will do the work for us. Start by importing the Pandas module.

import pandas

Learn about the Pandas module in our Pandas Tutorial.

The Pandas module allows us to read csv files and return a DataFrame object.

The file is meant for testing purposes only, you can download it here: data.csv

df = pandas.read_csv("data.csv")

Then make a list of the independent values and call this variable X.

Put the dependent values in a variable called y.

X = df[['Weight', 'Volume']]
y = df['CO2']

Tip: It is common to name the list of independent values with a upper case X, and the list of dependent values with a lower case y.

We will use some methods from the sklearn module, so we will have to import that module as well:

from sklearn import linear_model

From the sklearn module we will use the LinearRegression() method to create a linear regression object.

This object has a method called fit() that takes the independent and dependent values as parameters and fills the regression object with data that describes the relationship:

regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()
regr.fit(X, y)

Now we have a regression object that are ready to predict CO2 values based on a car's weight and volume:

#predict the CO2 emission of a car where the weight is 2300kg, and the volume is 1300cm3:
predictedCO2 = regr.predict([[2300, 1300]])
